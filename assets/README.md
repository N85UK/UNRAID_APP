# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets for the site.

## Required Assets (TODO)

### Images
- `logo.png` - Site logo (256x256 recommended)
- `favicon.png` - Browser favicon (32x32)
- `og-card.png` - Open Graph image for social sharing (1200x630)

### Notes
- All images should be optimized for web delivery
- WebP format is recommended for all images (98%+ browser support, better compression than PNG)
- Use PNG as fallback only for favicon compatibility
- Add `width` and `height` attributes to all `<img>` tags in index.md to prevent CLS

## Current Status
⚠️ **Placeholder assets needed** - These files are referenced in the site but not yet created.

Create these images and commit them to this directory.
